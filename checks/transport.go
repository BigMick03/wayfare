// SSRF protection for URLs published by the subjects being audited.
//
// # Why this is not paranoia here
//
// Most SSRF advice concerns URLs a user submits. This is worse: the URLs come
// from stellar.toml documents published by the anchors this tool exists to
// audit, and they are fetched by a server on behalf of anyone who asks for a
// corridor. An anchor that wanted to could publish
//
//	WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT = "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
//
// and every deployment probing it would read its own cloud metadata. Loopback
// and private ranges are the same problem pointed at whatever else the host
// can reach.
//
// The input is adversarial by construction, so the transport treats it that
// way.
//
// # Why the check is on the dialled address
//
// Validating the hostname before connecting is not enough: DNS can resolve a
// public-looking name to 127.0.0.1, and a redirect can move the request
// somewhere else entirely. Checking inside Dialer.Control catches the address
// actually being connected to, on the initial request and on every redirect,
// after resolution.

// maxErrorBody bounds how much of a non-OK response is read.
//
// A controlled endpoint can return an arbitrarily large body, and decoding it
// whole would let any anchor exhaust the memory of everything probing it.
