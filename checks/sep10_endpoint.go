// SEP10EndpointResponds probes whether an anchor's declared authentication
// endpoint actually answers.
//
// # Why declared and working are different facts
//
// A stellar.toml is a claim. WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT says "authenticate here", and
// nothing in the document proves anything is listening. Three states matter and
// are routinely conflated:
//
//	not declared     the anchor offers no programmatic authentication
//	declared, dead   the anchor says it does, and does not
//	declared, live   it works
//
// The middle one is the interesting case, and it is invisible to anyone who
// only reads the TOML. It is also the more damning: publishing an endpoint that
// does not answer says something about how an anchor is operated that silence
// does not.
//
// # What it can determine
//
// Whether the declared endpoint returns a well-formed SEP-10 challenge for a
// syntactically valid account.
//
// # What it cannot determine
//
// Whether the challenge is *correctly signed*, or would be accepted back. This
// deliberately does not verify the signature: doing so requires the anchor's
// signing key and an XDR parse, and a challenge that is well-formed but
// mis-signed is a different, narrower defect that deserves its own check.
//
// It also cannot distinguish an anchor that is down right now from one that is
// permanently broken. A single probe is a moment, not a pattern — telling those
// apart needs history.

// to any well-formed account, whether or not it is funded.
