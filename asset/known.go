// Verified mainnet issuers.
//
// Every issuer here was read from the issuer's own published stellar.toml
// (SEP-1) rather than copied from a block explorer or a blog post. Asset code
// alone is never sufficient identification: anyone can issue a token called
// "USDC", and a router that matched on code alone would happily quote a
// worthless lookalike. The verification date is recorded because anchors do
// rotate issuers.
//
// Verification status, 2026-08-08, read from
// https://ngnc.online/.well-known/stellar.toml:
//
//   - NGNC   VERIFIED, status="live". Issued by LINK.IO LTD., pegged 1:1 to
//     NGN, anchor_asset_type="fiat". NETWORK_PASSPHRASE = public mainnet.
//
//   - GHSC   VERIFIED as published, status="pending". Same issuing account as
//     NGNC. The anchor itself does not declare this asset in service.
//
//   - KESC   VERIFIED as published, status="pending". Same issuing account.
//     Note the entry sets anchor_asset="KESC", naming its own token rather
//     than the ISO-4217 code KES that SEP-1 intends. Read as KES.
//
//   - USDC   NOT YET VERIFIED against circle.com's stellar.toml. This is the
//     widely-published Circle issuer and Horizon accepted it for live
//     orderbook and path queries, which proves it is a real, actively traded
//     issuer — but not that it is Circle's. Confirm before any mainnet
//     execution path ships. See VerifyAgainstTOML in package anchor.
//
// The pending status on GHSC and KESC is a first-class finding, not a detail
// to route around. Per SEP-1 only "live" means in service, and the monitor
// reports an asset its own issuer has not launched as exactly that rather
// than pricing it as though it were tradeable.
